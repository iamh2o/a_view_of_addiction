## Introduction and Thesis

For decades, the landscape of addiction treatment has been overwhelmingly shaped by the pervasive influence of 12-step programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA). This dominance—what I term the **"12-step paradigm primacy"**—has so monopolized the thinking, language, and institutions surrounding addiction that departures from its framework face immediate and substantial disadvantages. The dogmatic grip of this paradigm has not only sidelined alternative approaches but has also resulted in lost opportunities for therapies and interventions that were never fully explored or developed. In my own recovery journey, I’ve experienced firsthand the limitations of this one-size-fits-all model and the transformative potential of diverse, personalized options like Recovery Dharma and emerging medical interventions such as tirzepatide. This report chronicles my path, critiques the 12-step monopoly, and advocates for a broader, evidence-based approach to addiction treatment that honors individual needs and fosters innovation.

A critical limitation of many addiction recovery studies is their reliance on the "abstinence at 1 year" metric, which reduces the complex process of recovery to a binary outcome. This approach not only overlooks the progress of those who reduce their substance use but also risks discouraging individuals who experience setbacks. Fractional metrics, such as the percentage of days abstinent or reductions in use, offer a more humane and realistic measure of success. If widely adopted, these metrics would likely reveal higher success rates across interventions, fostering greater hope and engagement in recovery programs. As we critique the dominance of the 12-step paradigm, we must also challenge the metrics that reinforce its all-or-nothing philosophy.

## Trauma Background

My recovery journey is deeply influenced by an extensive trauma history spanning decades. Key experiences include childhood exposure to my father’s severe PTSD, multiple muggings and assaults, two sexual assaults, an attempted murder in Chile, internalized homophobia as a gay man in the 1980s, two near-death experiences with sepsis, 24 years of emotional abuse from relationships, and chronic illness. These events have significantly shaped my mental health and addiction struggles. My poem "gingerbread boy" captures the cultural stigma and self-hatred I endured in the 1980s. For the complete trauma history and full poem, see Appendix A.

## Recovery Journey

My journey to recovery from intravenous methamphetamine ("crank") use began in February 2023, after years of struggle and urging from friends. I entered rehab on January 28, 2023, and successfully completed it in March 2023. From there, I moved to a sober house for April and May 2023, before returning to my Oakland home in June 2023 with my dog, Chunk, and the support of dear friends. In May 2023, I secured a 30-hour-per-week job, traveling monthly to Boston until June 2024, and later transitioned to a 15-hour-per-week consulting role, which I still hold.

Rehab introduced me to various recovery tools, including 12-step programs, evidence-based treatments, meditation, tai chi, art therapy, and group sessions. However, by June 2023, I found the rigid structure of 12-step programs misaligned with my experiences and logic, leading me to feel excluded and destined to fail. I now view the 12-step model as a hindrance to the development of more inclusive recovery treatments. In July 2023, I discovered Recovery Dharma, a Buddhist-inspired program that resonated deeply with me, offering the flexibility and empowerment I had hoped to find in 12-step programs. Daily meditation became a cornerstone of my recovery.

Despite these efforts, my health did not improve as expected. Between 2021 and 2025, I saw nearly 150 doctors, endured two seven-day hospital stays for sepsis, and made dozens of ER and urgent care visits. In July 2024, I began taking tirzepatide, which alleviated my 29-year joint pain, normalized my weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar, and even curbed my obsessive behaviors. This intervention was pivotal in my physical and mental recovery.

In December 2024, a podcast on Stockholm syndrome and narcissistic abuse made me realize I had been in various abuse relationships for over 20 years. This revelation was overwhelming, leading to a relapse and a suicide attempt. However, I quickly sought help, stabilized, and enrolled in a 15-session Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) program in January 2025, which proved invaluable for addressing my PTSD.

Throughout February 2025, I faced critical health challenges, including E. coli and parasite infections, which were eventually linked to Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). With the help of AI, I self-diagnosed and began treatment, which has been effective.

I can add a few sentences on the almost univerally unhelpful impacts an assumption of perfection or striving for perfection induce.

From January 28, 2023, to February 29, 2025, I tracked my meth use with daily logs:
- **Total Days Since Rehab:** 764
- **Days on Meth:** 35
- **Days Meth-Free:** 729
- **Meth-Free Percentage:** 95.42%
- **Runs of Meth Use:** 5 (longest: 27 days pre-rehab)
- **Runs of Meth-Free Days:** 6 (longest: 339 days in 2023)

**Table 1: Summary of Recovery Metrics**

| Year | Total Days | Days on Meth | Days Meth-Free | % Meth-Free | Meth Runs | Meth-Free Runs |
|------|------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2023 | 339        | 27           | 339            | 100%*       | 1         | 1              |
| 2024 | 366        | 2            | 364            | 99.45%      | 2         | 3              |
| 2025 | 59         | 6            | 53             | 89.83%      | 2         | 2              |
| Total| 764        | 35           | 729            | 95.42%      | 5         | 6              |

*Note: 2023 % meth-free is post-rehab (January 28 onward).

### Unique Struggles and Supports

**Struggles:**
- **Persistent Health Issues:** Despite being meth-free, my health deteriorated, requiring nearly 150 doctor visits, multiple ER visits, and hospital stays for sepsis. A late 2024 MCAS diagnosis compounded these challenges.
- **December 2024 Relapse:** Triggered by recognizing a large number of abusive relationships not recognized to that point, this relapse involved a suicide attempt, highlighting the intersection of mental health and addiction. THe outcome of this relapse was enrollment in the [Nema Health CPT program for PTSD](https://nemahealth.com)

**Supports:**
- **Family & Friends** Critical in providing outside perspective on growing crises stemming from addiction. Best positioned to offer gentle & constant pressure to reach out for help when ready.
- **Pschiatric** Psych dr...
- **Therapy** Weekly, by Psychiatrist
- **Intentional & Guided Psychedelic Experiences** 5MEODMT, DMT, LSD, MDMA.
- **Dancing** try not to feel better and connected to others dancinfg.
- **[Silicon Valley Recovery](https://www.siliconvalleyrecovery.com)** Residential dual diagnosis treatment in San Jose.
- **Recovery Dharma:** Adopted in July 2023, this Buddhist-inspired community replaced 12-step programs, enhancing my recovery through meditation and mindfulness.
- **Tirzepatide:** Started in July 2024, it alleviated joint pain, normalized health metrics, and reduced obsessive behaviors, supporting addiction healing.
- **Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT):** Enrolled in January 2025, this 15-session PTSD program provided critical mental health support.

### Probability of Sustained Recovery

Defining "returning to addiction" as 3 months (90 days) of continuous meth use, my longest post-rehab run was 3 days (2025), indicating no return. General relapse rates suggest 40–60% within the first year (NIDA, 2020), but my minimal relapses (35 days total, mostly single-day or 3-day runs), robust supports, and ongoing treatment suggest an 85–90% probability of sustained recovery. Alternative definitions (e.g., >10% of days on meth) also support this, as my 4.58% usage rate is low.

## Reflections

### Recovery Capture via Anarchy at Scale


My journey showed me recovery isn’t one-size-fits-all, yet via the magic of emergent properties of anarchist organizations at scale (AA is the most successfuul in the world!) the 12-step model’s dominance overshadows other paths: in all sectors of life. 

I valued the chance to study it up close, but my 12-step experience was ultimately a net-negative. Its spiritual focus didn’t click, and its rigidity stifled innovation, sidelining alternatives better suited to diverse needs. Recovery Dharma’s mindfulness practices became my lifeline, while medical interventions like tirzepatide tackled the physical side of addiction. Counseling and peer networks offered vital psychological support. Recovery thrives on variety, not a single playbook.

This report is not a rejection of 12-step programs—they remain a lifeline for many—but an urgent call to build on what we know works and to embrace optimism and intentional evolution in addiction recovery. We must move beyond rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches and create a recovery landscape that is both scalable in operations as well as adaptable intervention programming, inclusive, and driven by evidence. By fostering a mindset of hope and innovation, we can accelerate the development of more effective treatment paradigms and ensure new developments get to the clinics faster than this happens presently.

*rework*
This report is a criticism of the emergent recovery systems & thinking capture situation that has become entrenched. The 12-step empire—let’s call it what it is—has pulled off a slick recovery systems capture, sinking its claws into the addiction treatment landscape and holding it hostage with a rigid, outdated playbook. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and its offshoots have scaled impressively, sure, reaching millions with a cookie-cutter framework that bends just enough to fit different cultures while staying stubbornly fossilized at its core. That operational reach is undeniable—but it’s a hollow victory when the system can’t adapt to even the most basic, unassailable shifts in recovery science. Case in point: cigarettes.

Here’s the kicker—studies (like those from the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment) show that people leaving rehab as smokers have 50% worse odds of staying sober compared to non-smokers. That’s not some fringe hypothesis; it’s a screaming red flag. Smoking doesn’t just tank sobriety rates—it drags along a laundry list of health disasters: cancer, heart disease, lung failure. Yet AA, with its sanctimonious “full sobriety” gospel, turns a blind eye. Meetings reek of tobacco, and the Big Book—untouched since the 1930s—doesn’t whisper a word about it. This isn’t oversight; it’s structural paralysis. The 12-step machine is so ossified, so shackled to its dogma, that it can’t muster the will to tackle a drug staring them in the face—one that’s killing their success rates and their members.

How does AA justify this? They don’t. They lean on tradition like it’s a sacred shield, enforcing draconian rules about alcohol and narcotics while letting nicotine slide as a cultural quirk. It’s hypocrisy dressed up as principle. The organization’s anarchistic structure has effectively paralyzed its ability to make substantive changes to its core materials or core approachrethink its approach isn’t just stagnation—. Meanwhile, evidence-based recovery demands flexibility: scalable systems that don’t just spread wide but evolve deep, folding in new data to actually work better. AA’s refusal to do this—starting with something as obvious as cigarettes—proves it’s less about recovery and more about preserving its own grip on the game.

This isn’t a total takedown—12-step helps plenty—but it’s a wake-up call. We need treatment that doesn’t just coast on past glory but fights to adapt, using science to boost survival, not cling to relics. Until AA reckons with its cigarette blind spot (and the rest of its frozen ideology), it’s failing the very people it preaches to.

### AAAA Ref....
text Anarchy and Alcohol (available online via their publications) explicitly ties AA to anarchism and praises its success as a decentralized model. Paired with the Cochrane review’s empirical evidence of effectiveness (published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012880.pub2), these sources collectively support the case.

### Poem: "gingerbread boy" by John Major, 2025.01.13
'gingerbread boy'

now

“I love my shape.
My shape is a nice shape.
It’s my shape.
I don’t need to hurt my shape any more.
I hope not”

to now

“I hated my shape. Culture hated the shape it shamed me for not being. My shape blazed in agony. Twisted. Screaming, no- Screamed for an end. Screamed and screamed. please. just end.”

“Culture hurt me. Fake shape. Starved shape. Hidden shape. Vile shape. Hated shape.”

“Culture hurt me in the 80’s because it was ignorant and afraid.”

“Culture hurt me in the 80’s and it’s not my fault.”

“Culture hurt me in the 80’s and I could not bear this understanding till now.”

“Culture hurt me in the 80’s and I could not understand this till now.”

“Culture hurt me in the 80’s and I did not understand this till now.”

“Culture made no excuses for its hatred. Which is a good policy.”

“Culture forced me to believe something I did not want to believe.”

“Culture
raped my sense-of-self.
God hates
sick fags
would
should die.
Alone in desperate pain.
Deserves nothing
embrace
love
life
help
love
life.
I said nothing and no one knew.
Yet it happened for all to see.
On tv and Off.
No one helped even me.“

“I’m kinda stuck in the 80’s ( and obsessed ).” — JEM

“I’m obsessed with the 80’s (and kinda stuck ).” — JEM

far off now

“it’s like something in you broke in the 80’s and is stuck there.” — SD, (a roared observation over decades)

finally now

My shape is just fine.
